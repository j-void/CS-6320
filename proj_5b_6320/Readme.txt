**Setup:
	For this part, we will be using Google Colab, which is a cloud based jupyter notebook environment. You can choose to run this part 	locally as well, especially if you have a good GPU, but the assignment is designed to run on Colab with GPU. You’ll first need to 	upload proj5.2_6320/mc-cnn.ipynb to Google Colab first, then you’ll be able to run them the same way you run any other notebook.
	In Colab, make sure you select GPU in the menu “Runtime” -> “Change runtime time” -> “Hardward accelerator”

**Submission:
	Similar to part 1, this part requires a report to be submitted on gradescope along with a zip archive to be submitted on canvas 	containing the filled in jupyter notebook and .pth file for your best model.
	Fill in the relevant details in proj5b_template.pptx and export it as a pdf to generate the report. This has to be submitted on 	gradescope.

**Rubric:
	This project is worth 50 points, the points for each section is specified in proj5b_template.pptx.
