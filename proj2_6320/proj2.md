# CS 6320 project 2:
# Setup
1. Install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). It doesn't matter whether you use Python 2 or 3 because we will create our own environment that uses 3 anyways.
2. Create a conda environment using the appropriate command. On Windows, open the installed "Conda prompt" to run the command. On MacOS and Linux, you can just use a terminal window to run the command: `conda env create -f proj2_env.yml`
3. This should create an environment named 'proj2'. Activate it using the Windows command, `activate proj2` or the MacOS / Linux command, `source activate proj2`
4. Run the notebook using `jupyter notebook `
5. Generate the zip folder for the code portion of your submission once you've finished the project using `python zip_submission.py --uid <your_uid>`
